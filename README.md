## 👋 About Me

I’m a Software Developer with a strong foundation in full-stack web development and a growing focus on AI-powered applications. Currently pursuing a BSc in Information Technology at Bhavan’s College, Mumbai, I enjoy building scalable, real-world solutions that combine clean user interfaces with robust backend logic.

I have hands-on experience developing applications using React, Django, FastAPI, and modern databases like MySQL and MongoDB. My projects range from NLP-to-SQL systems that convert natural language into database queries, to AI chatbots built with LLMs and LangChain, and data-driven dashboards with interactive visualizations.

I’m particularly interested in:

Building AI-integrated web applications

Designing efficient APIs and backend architectures

Turning complex problems into simple, user-friendly solutions

I value clean code, continuous learning, and problem-solving, and I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and work on impactful software products.
